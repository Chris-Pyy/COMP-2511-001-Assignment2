                <p class="information">
                Application Development has always been a huge proponent of the Development field, being closely tied to Software Development, Application Development came as a necessity for software.
                <br> Application Development due to this fact has been the most popular field of Development out of the three. This means that this field has the biggest range of languages each with their unique features and quirks.
                <br> The most popular and beginner friendly languages to learn range from usage and function but the most popular ones are python, Java, C, C++, Swift, R and Go.

                <p class="information">
                Software Development has been the longest exsisting Development field out of the three discussed. Being said you can imagine there is a huge variety of languages created towards Software Development,
                <br>due to this reason we brought together the most popular Software Development programming languages being currently used which are C and C++
                <br>These two have been closely knit to the core of Software Development and are the two main languages any software dev learns when starting out
