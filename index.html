                        Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions are known as code, programmers write code to solve problems or perform various tasks.
                        <br><br>The form of these instructions take depend on the programming language used. Languages can include very low level forms like Machine Language or Assembly, or very high level forms like Java. 
                        <br><br>Lower level languages
                        are more complex and harder to understand, while high level language is very programmer friendly and easy to understand. High level is much preferred over low level for most instances because it is efficient and easy to maintain.

                    <h2>About Java</h2>
                    <div>Java is top pick as one of the most popular programming languages, used for building server-side applications to video games and mobile apps. It's also the core foundation for developing Android apps, making it a favorite of many programmers. With its WORA mantra (write once, run anywhere), it's designed to be portable and run happily across multiple software platforms</div>
                </div>
                <div class="boxes"> 
                    <h2>About Python</h2>
                    <div>Python is a one-stop shop. There's a Python framework for pretty much anything, from web apps to data analysis. In fact, WordStream is written in Python! You're the best bud. Python is often heralded as the easiest programming language to learn, with its simple and straightforward syntax. Python has risen in popularity due to Google's investment in it over the past decade (in fact, one recent study has shown Python to be the most commonly taught programming language in U.S. schools). Other applications built with Python include Pinterest and Instagram.</div>

                <div class="boxes"> 
                    <h2>About C</h2>
                    <div>If you saw C on a report card, you'd be pretty bummed. Maybe a bit confused, too (is it actually a B-?). However, C is not the bizarrely bad grade it seems to be. It's often the first programming language taught in college. It's a nice "in-between" language in that it was object oriented without having to be fanatical about it. It was also low level enough to be close to hardware, but no so low level that you had to do everything manually. Because there are so many C compilers, you can write stuff in C and have it run pretty much anywhere.</div>

                <div class="boxes"> 
                    <h2>About C#</h2>
                    <div>C# (pronounced C-sharp, not C-hashtag for you Twitter fans) is the language used in order to develop Microsoft apps. C# is syntactically nearly identical to Java. I've spent much time training with C#, but if you're good at Java, you'll likely have an easy time jumping onto C#. If you're looking to work on Microsoft apps, C# is the way to go.</div>
